## üöÄ How to Run (Google Colab Recommended)

1. Open each notebook in [Google Colab
2. Mount your Google Drive.
3. Ensure the following folders and files are available:
   - `/content/drive/MyDrive/MIT_Sloan/heatmaps_all/` (heatmap images)
   - `/content/drive/MyDrive/MIT_Sloan/position_stats_mean_per_min_small_class.csv` (stats CSV)
4. Run notebooks in order from MIT1 to MIT6.
