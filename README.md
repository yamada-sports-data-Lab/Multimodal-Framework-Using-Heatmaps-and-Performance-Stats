## üöÄ How to Run (Google Colab Recommended)

1. Open each notebook in [Google Colab](https://colab Google Drive.
2. Mount your Google Drive. 
3. Required folders and files will be automatically generated in your Google Drive  
   by running the MIT1 to MIT3 notebooks:

   - `/content/drive/MyDrive/MIT_Sloan/heatmaps_all/` ‚Äî Heatmap images  
   - `/content/drive/MyDrive/MIT_Sloan/position_stats_mean_per_min_small_class.csv` ‚Äî Stats CSV

4. Run the notebooks in order from MIT1 to MIT6.
